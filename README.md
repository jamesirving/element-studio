# element studio

A website to showcase the projects and products created by me, James Irving. Also a website to test and explore some of the following web tools:

- üöÄ [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) ‚Äî JavaScript Framework used to build the web application.
- üöÄ [React](https://reactjs.org) ‚Äî JavaScript library for user interfaces
- üìñ [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) ‚Äî UI component environment powered by Vite
- üç∞ [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) - Zero-runtime stylesheets in TypeScript
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
